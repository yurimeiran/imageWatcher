# imageWatcher
Console program that is watching for changes in directory, particularly for *.jpg type of files. If changes appear, then display it in console window, write it into text file, and ultimately insert new record into database. The base of the code is taken from MSDN site, FileSystemWatcher example. Just started and not much is done yet.
